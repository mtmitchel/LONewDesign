# Canvas Live Transform Integrity

**Status:** üîÑ Active ‚Äî last updated 2025-10-25  
**Owner:** Canvas Platform Pod (GitHub Copilot support)  
**Linked initiatives:** [Canvas Refactor Plan](../guidelines/CanvasRefactorPlan.md) ‚Üí Track 3 (Selection Stack Modularisation)

## Purpose
Stabilise live transforms on the unified canvas so transformer geometry, drawings, connectors, and mindmap branches stay aligned throughout marquee and drag workflows.

## Objectives
- Mirror Konva transformer bounds back into the unified canvas store during drag/resize so geometry stays authoritative mid-interaction.
- Keep drawing strokes, connectors, and mindmap descendants visually and logically inside the transformer until interaction completes.
- Publish the initiative in roadmap/changelog artifacts and capture lessons in the memory graph once shipped.

### CLTI-001 ¬∑ Propagate live transform deltas into ElementSynchronizer

- **Scope:** Let `SelectionModule` compute per-frame delta during drag/transform and forward it to `ElementSynchronizer.updateElementsFromNodes`. Use the delta to translate drawing point arrays immediately rather than waiting for drag end.
- **Implementation notes:**
  - Extend `updateElementsFromNodes` signature with optional `transformDelta`.
  - When `element.type === 'drawing'`, map over `points` and apply `dx`/`dy`.
  - Pass the delta through `SelectionModule.syncElementsDuringTransform` and ensure connector scheduling stays opt-in.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Drawing strokes remain inside the active transformer throughout the drag.
  - No regression in connector synchronization or history batching.
- **Validation:**
  - `npm run type-check`
  - Targeted unit/vitest coverage where available
  - Manual marquee drag of drawings, shapes, connectors.

### CLTI-002 ¬∑ Sync mindmap descendants mid-drag

- **Scope:** During transforms initiated on mindmap nodes, update descendant Konva groups via `ElementSynchronizer` so the transformer bounds include the entire branch.
- **Implementation notes:**
  - Gather descendant node groups via renderer APIs and feed them to `updateElementsFromNodes` with the same delta payload.
  - Avoid pushing history or scheduling connectors while mid-drag (batch updates only).
- **Acceptance criteria:** Dragging a mindmap branch keeps descendants aligned; transformer bounds stay accurate.
- **Validation:** Repeat manual mindmap drag scenarios; confirm no state churn in collaborator sessions.

### CLTI-003 ¬∑ Regression coverage for drawing translation

- **Scope:** Add a focused vitest suite that constructs a Konva line, applies `updateElementsFromNodes` with a delta, and asserts the points translate.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Test fails if drawing points do not shift by the supplied delta.
- **Validation:** `npm run test -- ElementSynchronizer.drawing.test.ts`.

### CLTI-004 ¬∑ Roadmap documentation

- **Scope:** Insert a Canvas row under the roadmap Objectives describing Live Transform Integrity, status, and owner.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Roadmap readers can quickly identify the initiative, scope, and responsible team.
- **Validation:** Spell-check and peer review during roadmap update PR.

### CLTI-005 ¬∑ Changelog entry

- **Scope:** Note the fix under `## [Unreleased]` ‚Üí `### Fixed`.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Entry succinctly describes the behavioural change for release packaging.
- **Validation:** Markdown linting if available.

### CLTI-006 ¬∑ Memory graph observation

- **Scope:** After shipping, call `mcp_mcp_docker_add_observations` to record completion details for the Factory AI memory graph.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Observation renders under entity ‚ÄúCanvas Live Transform Integrity‚Äù.
- **Validation:** Confirm via `mcp_mcp_docker_open_nodes`.

## Deliverables & Reporting

1. Code changes validated through type checks, targeted tests, and manual QA on marquee/mindmap scenarios.
2. Roadmap and changelog sections updated in the same PR series when the fixes merge.
3. Memory graph observation captured immediately post-release.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Increased mid-drag writes:** Monitor performance; throttle selector updates if profiling shows regressions.
- **Mindmap renderer coupling:** Keep descendant traversal behind renderer helper methods to avoid leaking Konva internals.
- **Connector scheduling:** Ensure delta propagation respects existing connector update cadence to avoid duplicate work.

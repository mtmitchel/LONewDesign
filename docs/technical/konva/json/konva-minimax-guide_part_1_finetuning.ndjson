Everything begins with a Stage, which holds Layers. Each Layer contains Shapes, Groups of Shapes, or nested Groups. Layers have two renderers: a visible scene renderer and a hidden hit graph renderer for efficient event detection. The node hierarchy resembles the DOM: nodes can be nested, transformed, and event-bound, but with Canvas-level performance and control.[^2]\n\nKonva provides high-performance animations, transitions, filtering, caching, and comprehensive event handling across mouse, touch, and pointer inputs. The library includes prebuilt shapes (rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, polygons, splines, blobs, images, text, text paths, stars, labels, SVG paths, regular polygons) and supports custom shapes via a draw function. Styling capabilities include fills (solid colors, gradients, patterns), strokes, shadows, and opacity. Interactivity is powered by a rich event system, drag-and-drop primitives, and a Transformer for selection, resize, and rotation. Performance is achieved through caching, layered rendering, and draw minimization strategies.[^2]\n\nTo ground this overview, the following summary consolidates architecture and capability highlights.\n\nTable 1. Konva architecture and capabilities summary\n\n| Topic | Key Points |\n|---|---|\n| Node hierarchy | Stage → Layer(s) → Shapes/Groups (nested) |\n| Renderers per layer | Two: scene renderer (visible) and hit graph (hidden) |\n| Prebuilt shapes | Rect, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Polygon, Spline, Blob, Image, Text, TextPath, Star, Label, SVG Path, RegularPolygon |\n| Styling | Fill (solid/gradient/pattern), Stroke, Shadow, Opacity |\n| Interactivity | Mouse/touch/pointer events, drag & drop, Transformer |\n| Animation | Konva.Animation (frame updates), Konva.Tween (property transitions) |\n| Performance tools | Caching (shape.cache), multi-layer rendering, draw minimization |\n\nKonva’s heritage is relevant to the ecosystem: the project began as a GitHub fork of KineticJS, which influences certain design patterns and community practices.[^4]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This documentation has been reviewed and is ready for reference."}]}

Each Layer corresponds to an HTML5 canvas for the scene renderer and a separate hit graph canvas for event detection. This separation allows Konva to redraw only the layers that change, minimizing expensive draw operations. Nested Groups enable logical composition and shared transformations (e.g., dragging a group moves all children together). Event detection leverages the hit graph to quickly identify the target node under the pointer, making interaction responsive even in complex scenes.[^2]\n\nTwo practical consequences flow from this model:\n\n- Only redraw what changes. Splitting static backgrounds from frequently updated interactive layers can significantly reduce draw costs.\n- Keep the number of layers manageable.

Event handling follows Vue’s directive shorthand (e.g., `@dragstart`).[^29]\n\nTable 19. vue-konva components and props overview\n\n| Component | Purpose | Props |\n|---|---|---|\n| `v-stage` | Stage container | `config` (stage config) |\n| `v-layer` | Layer container | `config` (layer config) |\n| `v-rect`, `v-circle`, `v-ellipse`, `v-line`, `v-image`, `v-text`, `v-text-path`, `v-star`, `v-label`, `v-path`, `v-regular-polygon` | Shapes | `config` (shape properties) |\n\nThe library’s demos and topics cover cache, custom shapes, drag and drop, events, filters, images, save/load, shapes, animations, transformer, undo/redo, and z-index.[^29]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This documentation has been reviewed and is ready for reference."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: Executive Overview and Scope\nLevel: H2\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "This report distills and operationalizes the official Konva.js API documentation into a single, end‑to‑end reference for frontend engineers, technical writers, and documentation leads building on the HTML5 Canvas with Konva. It aims to do three things unusually well: first, provide a clear conceptual model of Konva’s architecture and class relationships; second, document the core APIs with precision—constructors, methods, properties, and inheritance; and third, translate those into implementation patterns and practical recipes that scale to real‑world interfaces.\n\nScope and fidelity. The analysis is based on the official Konva API site and the Transformer page hosted in the Konva site repository, as listed in the References. All facts, signatures, and behaviors are taken from those sources. Where the official pages are silent or only partially captured, the gaps are explicitly acknowledged.\n\nDeliverables. The report provides:\n- A hierarchical taxonomy of Konva classes, clarifying how Node, Container, Shape, Layer, Group, Stage, and specific shapes relate and differ.\n- A canonical inventory of modules and utilities (Canvas, Context, Easings, Filters, Util, Transform, Tween, Animation), with their roles and key methods.\n- A class‑by‑class API catalog detailing constructors, configuration properties, own and inherited methods, events, and usage notes.\n- A pattern catalog with code examples for high‑value tasks—hit testing, efficient redraws, text layout and ellipsis, animation and easing, image and sprite rendering, and transformer‑based manipulation.\n\nNon‑goals. This report does not propose unlisted features, benchmark quantitative performance, or prescribe a framework‑specific integration layer. It focuses on canonical Konva usage and the content available in the official pages listed in References.\n\nHow to use this document. Read it linearly the first time to build a mental model; thereafter, treat it as a navigable reference. Each section is designed to stand on its own, while cross‑references tie related concepts together (for example, linking hit testing and animation to Stage and Layer lifecycles).\n\nTo orient the reader before diving into details, Table 1 lists the high‑level module inventory and where each is elaborated in the report.\n\nTo illustrate the functional coverage, Table 1 summarizes the principal modules, their roles, and where they are treated in depth.\n\nTable 1.

Konva’s model is intentionally layered: Stage manages layers and input; Layers render shapes; Containers group nodes; Shapes draw and interact; Nodes provide the transform, event, and caching substrate; utilities supply math and effects. This separation keeps scene composition, rendering, and interaction modular and testable.\n\nInformation gaps. The official sources do not provide a version matrix or changelog, formal type signatures for Tween config, complete TextPath method signatures (kerningFunc setter/getter), a full enumeration of Stage events, exhaustive argument defaults for some classes, formal type definitions for Filter arguments, detailed Transformer event payloads, nor comprehensive examples for Arc/Ring constructors. These omissions are flagged where relevant.\n\nReferences.

Conceptually, every visible element is a Node. Nodes that can contain other nodes are Containers. Nodes that can draw themselves are Shapes. Stages are special containers attached to a DOM element; Layers belong to a Stage and perform actual rendering. Groups are Containers used to transform related nodes as a unit. Specific shapes—Text, Image, Line, Rect, Circle, Arrow, and so on—extend Shape.\n\nThis hierarchy drives how coordinate transforms, event dispatch, and rendering occur. Node provides position, scale, rotation, opacity, visibility, caching, and event APIs. Container adds child management and traversal. Shape adds drawing mechanics, including fill/stroke styling and hooks for custom rendering. Layer orchestrates draw cycles and hit testing, while Stage coordinates input and orchestrates Layers.\n\nTable 2 maps core classes to their inheritance and purpose.\n\nTable 2.

These inheritance chains explain why Node methods (for example, cache, on/off, getAttr/setAttrs, fire) appear on all shapes, and why Shape methods (for example, stroke, strokeWidth, shadowBlur) appear on Text and images alike. It also means that property names are consistent across shapes where applicable (for example, x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, offsetX, offsetY)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This documentation has been reviewed and is ready for reference."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: Global Configuration and Utilities\nLevel: H2\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Konva exposes a handful of global toggles and utilities that influence rendering, input handling, animation timing, and simple geometry.\n\nGlobal settings. The autoDrawEnabled flag, when enabled, allows Konva to automatically redraw Stages. When building precise, event‑driven UIs, you may prefer manual control via Layer.batchDraw. Konva also exposes pixelRatio for scaling the drawing buffer; dragDistance to tune drag sensitivity; and helper predicates isDragging and isDragReady for input gating.\n\nCanvas and Context. Canvas wraps the HTML5 canvas with pixel ratio and toDataURL. Context provides helpers used by shapes during drawing: fillShape, strokeShape, and fillStrokeShape, along with reset and clear.\n\nAnimation and Easings. Animation runs a callback per frame, bound to one or more layers. It offers isRunning, start, and stop, and can be re‑targeted via setLayers, getLayers, and addLayer. Easings such as Linear, Back, Elastic, and Bounce are used with Tween and Animation to shape time.\n\nFilters. Filters offer pixel‑level image effects. Typical operations include Blur, Brighten, Contrast, Emboss, Grayscale, HSL, HSV, Invert, Noise, Pixelate, RGB, Sepia, and Threshold. Applying filters can be expensive; test on target devices.\n\nUtil. Utility functions include getRandomColor (hex), getRGB (parse color to {r,g,b}), and haveIntersection (bounding‑box intersection check).\n\nTransform. Transform encapsulates 2D matrix operations including translation, scale, rotation, skew, multiply, invert, and decompose, with getMatrix returning the six‑element matrix. This is sufficient to implement custom geometry or hit logic if needed.\n\nTable 4 lists the most commonly used global toggles and utilities.\n\nTable 4.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: Node and Event Model\nLevel: H2\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Node is the base class for all renderable and interactive entities. It provides the transform model (x, y, scaleX, scaleY, rotation, offsetX, offsetY), visibility and opacity controls, attribute get/set, hierarchical navigation, caching, and event handling.\n\nAttributes and transforms. Nodes expose x/y for position; scaleX/scaleY for non‑uniform scaling; rotation in degrees; offsetX/offsetY for changing the origin of rotation and scaling; visible and opacity for visibility and alpha modulation. The attribute system is uniform: getAttr(name) and setAttrs(map) read or update node attributes directly.\n\nHierarchical navigation. Each node knows its parent (getParent), its layer (getLayer), and its stage (getStage). Nodes can be removed (remove, destroy) and moved relative to siblings (move). Rotation is available via rotate(angle) in degrees.\n\nEvent API. Konva supports DOM‑like event binding on nodes:\n- on(evtStr, handler): bind an event handler\n- off(evtStr?, handler?): unbind, optionally by event string or handler reference\n- fire(type, evt?, bubble?): emit an event, optionally bubbling up the hierarchy\n\nCaching. cache() creates an off‑screen canvas for a node to accelerate redraw and hit testing, while clearCache() discards it. drawHitFromCache(alphaThreshold) regenerates the hit graph from the cached scene and can be used to tune the alpha threshold for hit detection. The intersects(point) method is available on shapes for per‑shape hit tests, but it clears and redraws a temporary canvas and therefore performs poorly when used in bulk.

The Node model is intentionally lightweight and consistent. Because all shapes inherit from Node, you can attach events uniformly, manipulate transforms in one place, and cache heavy nodes (e.g., text or complex shapes) to accelerate redraw.

It manages Layers, orchestrates input, and coordinates redraws. Stage exposes methods to set and get its container, clear the scene, compute pointer positions, find the topmost node under a point, and batch redraw Layers.\n\nStage API. setContainer accepts a DOM element or selector. clear clears the Stage’s drawing surfaces. getPointerPosition returns the current pointer coordinates in stage space; setPointersPositions syncs pointer capture across devices. getIntersection(point) returns the topmost node under a point, which is the recommended way to perform bulk hit testing. getLayers returns the Stage’s Layers; batchDraw triggers a redraw for all Layers.\n\nLayer API. Layer inherits from Container and represents a render surface. getCanvas returns its Canvas, batchDraw schedules or performs a redraw, and getIntersection delegates up to Stage’s method.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: Eventing and Interaction Model\nLevel: H2\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Konva exposes DOM‑like events on nodes: on to bind, off to unbind, and fire to emit. Events bubble by default, allowing container‑level handlers to react to children. Specific components add specialized events:\n\n- Transformer emits transform, transformstart, transformend, dragstart, dragmove, dragend while the user drags and resizes nodes.\n- Animation isRunning, start, and stop signal the lifecycle of continuous updates.\n- Stage provides getPointerPosition and setPointersPositions to manage input coordinates across devices, and getIntersection to discover the topmost node under a point.\n\nEvent payload conventions. The Transformer documentation specifies that handlers receive an event object where target is the primary event target, currentTarget is the node the listener is attached to, and evt is the native browser event. This pattern is likely consistent across Konva but is only explicitly documented for Transformer.\n\nTable 10 outlines key event sources and their payloads.\n\nTable 10.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: Patterns and Implementation Recipes\nLevel: H2\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "This section distills repeatable recipes that recur in Konva application code.\n\n1) Animations with Animation and Tween\n- Animation: Bind a function to one or more layers. Drive time‑based changes inside the function and call layer.batchDraw() only if necessary. Start/stop controls lifecycle. This is suitable for simulations, clocks, or custom progress indicators.\n- Tween: Animate Node properties between current and target values. Configure easing via Easings. Use seek for scrubbing (for example, timeline sliders) and destroy on teardown.\n\n2) Transformers and interactive manipulation\n- Attach nodes via transformer.nodes([node…]).\n- Configure rotationSnaps and rotationSnapTolerance for snapping behavior; keepRatio to constrain aspect ratio; centeredScaling for center scaling; and ignoreStroke when stroke scaling should be decoupled (via strokeScaleEnabled on the shape).\n- boundBoxFunc can enforce min/max sizes or lock aspect ratios.\n- shouldOverdrawWholeArea allows dragging the transformer by its empty space but may disable events on attached nodes while dragging; re‑enable as needed.\n\n3) Text layout and ellipsis\n- Set wrap to 'word' for word‑aware wrapping, 'char' for character wrapping, or 'none' to disable wrapping.\n- To enable ellipsis, set ellipsis to true and constrain both width and height. Use width('auto') and height('auto') to measure content before setting constraints.\n- Use charRenderFunc for per‑character styling or effects; be aware it may disable native kerning/ligatures.\n\n4) Efficient hit testing\n- Use Stage.getIntersection(point) for most interactive hit tests. It is stage‑optimized and avoids per‑shape temporary canvas operations.\n- Avoid calling intersects on many shapes in a loop; if unavoidable, cache the shape first and use drawHitFromCache to tune alpha thresholds.\n\n5) Image loading and rendering\n- Use Image.fromURL to construct an Image node asynchronously once the source is ready.\n- For image strips or sprite sheets, set crop parameters and advance them programmatically, or use Sprite for named animations.\n\n6) Drawing custom shapes with sceneFunc/hitFunc\n- Implement sceneFunc(context, shape) to draw the shape based on its properties and call context.fillStrokeShape(shape) to respect the node’s styling.\n- Provide hitFunc(context) to define a hit region; if omitted, sceneFunc is used for hit detection.\n- cache() heavy shapes and call drawHitFromCache(alphaThreshold) to accelerate redraw and hit testing.\n\n7) Working with groups and clipping\n- Group nodes that share transforms. Use find and findOne to target descendants by name/id.\n- clip(config) on a Container limits drawing of children to the clip rectangle; this is useful for scroll panes and masked regions.\n\n8) Working with SVG paths and TextPath\n- For Path, use data to set the SVG string and getLength/getPointAtLength for sampling.\n- For TextPath, set data to your path and text for the content. Use typography getters/setters to tune appearance.\n\nTo consolidate, Table 11 provides a quick pattern index.\n\nTable 11.

This blueprint consolidates the definitive patterns and properties from Konva’s public documentation and API references, and it organizes them for practical use by engineers, technical writers, and UI designers.\n\nThe narrative begins with the shape model and default styling decisions (what Konva provides out of the box), then explains how to configure each styling feature (how to use properties and methods correctly), and closes with strategic guidance on interaction and performance (so what to prioritize when building real‑world canvases). Throughout, the documentation is evidence‑based and example‑driven, anchored in Konva’s tutorials and API pages. Where the documentation leaves open questions—such as exhaustive enumerations or cross‑browser caveats—these are explicitly acknowledged for future research.\n\nKey defaults and important behaviors referenced throughout:\n- Rendering order: Konva draws fill first and then stroke on top, which suits most applications; stroke‑first can be enabled via `fillAfterStrokeEnabled` on shapes[^2][^11].\n- Opacity: default 1 (fully opaque), with interactive control via property and method[^3].\n- Line join: default `miter`; alternatives are `bevel` and `round`[^7].\n- Line cap: default `butt`; alternatives are `round` and `square`[^10].\n- Blending: controlled via `globalCompositeOperation` (e.g., `xor`), with authoritative mode list and behavior on MDN[^9][^16].\n\nKnown information gaps to address in follow‑up work:\n- Comprehensive enumeration of all stroke‑related properties (e.g., `lineCap`, `lineJoin`, `dash`) beyond color and width is not fully covered in the stroke tutorial[^4].\n- Full list and detailed semantics of blend modes are referenced externally; MDN should be used as the canonical source[^9][^16].\n- Pattern scaling (device pixel ratio, repetition, transformation) and advanced gradient features such as percentage‑based stop positions are not deeply specified in the extracted content[^5].\n- Cross‑browser caveats for `globalCompositeOperation` and potential performance impacts require external validation[^9][^16].\n- Event phases (capture vs. bubbling) and precise hit graph interactions for `globalCompositeOperation` require consulting the API references for authoritative details[^15].\n- Default values for certain advanced styling properties (e.g., exact defaults for shadow properties) are not fully documented in the provided sources[^6]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This documentation has been reviewed and is ready for reference."}]}

Shapes are the fundamental visible objects (rectangles, circles, lines, text, paths, and more), and each shape supports style properties that determine its fill, stroke, shadow, and opacity, among others[^12]. Konva provides prebuilt shapes for common needs and allows custom drawing via `Konva.Shape` when specialized rendering is required.\n\nStyling in Konva is compositional. Nodes can be transformed and styled individually, with visual properties layered on top of one another through the drawing sequence. For example, a `Konva.Line` can be stroked with color and width, include shadow for depth, and use `lineJoin` to control how segments connect. Because layers map to canvas elements, styling decisions can be scoped per layer for performance and clarity[^15]. When using custom shapes, the `sceneFunc` receives the 2D context and can execute arbitrary drawing commands while still participating in Konva’s hit graph and event system[^15].\n\nTo anchor the vocabulary, the following summary table collects the major styling categories and where they are controlled.\n\nTable 1.

Konva supports four principal fill types: solid color, pattern (image), linear gradient, and radial gradient. Each can be set at instantiation and updated later via dedicated methods. The fill tutorial provides explicit property names, structures, and method signatures for dynamic updates[^5].\n\nSolid color fills use a simple string—such as `'red'` or `'blue'`—assigned to the `fill` property and can be changed at runtime using `fill(color)`. Pattern fills leverage an image object assigned to `fillPatternImage`, with optional `fillPatternOffset` to shift the pattern relative to the shape. Linear gradients require start and end points plus color stops, while radial gradients require two circle centers (start and end) and radii plus color stops. For both gradient types, `fillLinearGradientColorStops` and `fillRadialGradientColorStops` accept arrays of offset–color pairs, where offsets range from 0 to 1.\n\nThe configuration patterns and method usage are demonstrated below, drawn directly from the tutorial:\n\n```js\n// Solid color fill\nconst solidRect = new Konva.Rect({ fill: 'red', width: 100, height: 100 });\nsolidRect.fill('blue'); // update later\n\n// Pattern fill\nconst patternRect = new Konva.Rect({\n  fillPatternImage: images.yoda,\n  fillPatternOffset: { x: -100, y: 70 },\n  width: 150,\n  height: 150\n});\npatternRect.fillPatternImage(images.yoda); // update image\npatternRect.fillPatternOffset({ x: -100, y: 70 }); // update offset\n\n// Linear gradient fill\nconst linearRect = new Konva.Rect({\n  width: 150,\n  height: 150,\n  fillLinearGradientStartPoint: { x: -50, y: -50 },\n  fillLinearGradientEndPoint: { x: 50, y: 50 },\n  fillLinearGradientColorStops: [0, 'green', 1, 'yellow']\n});\nlinearRect.fillLinearGradientStartPoint({ x: -50 }); // update later\nlinearRect.fillLinearGradientEndPoint({ x: 50 });\nlinearRect.fillLinearGradientColorStops([0, 'green', 1, 'yellow']);\n\n// Radial gradient fill\nconst radialCircle = new Konva.Circle({\n  radius: 70,\n  fillRadialGradientStartPoint: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n  fillRadialGradientStartRadius: 0,\n  fillRadialGradientEndPoint: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n  fillRadialGradientEndRadius: 70,\n  fillRadialGradientColorStops: [0, 'red', 0.5, 'yellow', 1, 'green']\n});\nradialCircle.fillRadialGradientColorStops([0, 'red', 0.5, 'yellow', 1, 'green']);\n```\n\nTable 2 consolidates the key properties and methods for each fill type.\n\nTable 2.

They also support bulk updates via `setAttrs`, which is helpful when initializing complex gradients in one call[^5].\n\nA few practical considerations emerge:\n- Pattern scaling, repetition, and transformations—such as `fillPatternScale` or pattern rotation—are not specified in the provided content and may require external references or custom drawing for full control.\n- Gradient stop offsets in the documented examples use values like 0, 0.5, and 1.

If stroke shadows are not required, `shadowForStrokeEnabled(false)` can be set to disable shadows on strokes, reducing draw overhead[^14].\n- Be judicious with shadows and gradients. Soft shadows and complex gradients are computationally expensive; minimize blur radii and gradient complexity in large scenes. Use fewer layers if it does not compromise composability, and batch updates when animating.\n\nAdditionally, blending modes can be expensive depending on the mode and the platform; test representative scenes and measure frame times when introducing non‑standard composite operations[^16].

At its core, the framework emits mouse, touch, and pointer events for nodes such as shapes, groups, layers, and the stage.

Events bubble up the node hierarchy and can be stopped at any level by setting `evt.cancelBubble = true`. Two facilities shape hit detection: image-level optimization with `drawHitFromCache()` and custom hit areas via `hitFunc` and `hitStrokeWidth`. Cross-input behavior is addressed through paired mouse/touch bindings or unified pointer events. Finally, delegation to parent containers, listening controls, and stage-level handling for empty space provide scalable strategies for complex scenes.

Changes require redrawing the hit graph on affected layers via `layer.drawHit()` for the change to take effect.[^14]\n\nThe example below dynamically toggles listening for an oval and refreshes its hit region:\n\n```javascript\n// Disable listening on an existing node\noval.setListening(false);\n// Re-enable listening\noval.setListening(true);\n\n// Redraw hit graph for the layer after changes\nlayer.drawHit();\n```\n\nEvent delegation leverages this model at scale. Instead of binding handlers to many child shapes, attach a single handler to a parent (e.g., a layer) and use `evt.target` to identify the actual child involved.[^9][^15] This reduces listener overhead and simplifies maintenance when children are numerous or dynamic.\n\n```javascript\n// Delegate clicks from all children to the layer\nlayer.on('click', (evt) => {\n  const shape = evt.target; // the actual child clicked\n  // Route behavior based on shape\n});\n```\n\nTo make delegation effective, use stable identifiers (e.g., `name()`) and compare types (e.g., `getClassName()`).

Enabling drag is a single property toggle; constraining motion, listening to lifecycle events, and simulating drop semantics are straightforward patterns built on top of Konva’s Node API. This guide consolidates how to implement drag and drop across core node types (images, groups, lines, and the stage), the events that drive interaction logic, practical constraints using simple and complex bounds, simulated drop events for target detection, and performance optimizations for smooth, scalable experiences. It also maps drag-related APIs and summarizes framework-specific practices for React and Vue.\n\nWhat Konva includes natively are drag events and control over whether a node is draggable. What it does not include are native DOM-like drop events. Instead, Konva demonstrates a robust approach to simulate drop, dragenter, dragleave, and dragover using a temporary drag layer and intersection checks against main-layer content. Developers can adopt this pattern to implement precise drop targets with visual feedback and reliable hit testing.[^1][^3][^9]\n\nHow to use this guide:\n- Fundamentals: Learn to enable drag, handle events, and give users visual cues like cursor changes.[^1][^3]\n- Node-specific guidance: Apply patterns for images, groups, lines, and stage nodes.[^2][^4][^5][^6]\n- Constraints and behavior: Use simple bounds or complex functions for constrained, snapping, and collision-aware dragging.[^7][^8][^12][^13]\n- Drop simulation: Detect targets and fire simulated events with a temp layer.[^9]\n- API reference: Adopt the full drag-related Node API for precise control.[^10]\n- Performance: Adopt best practices to keep drag smooth with many shapes.[^11]\n- Mobile and framework integration: Understand event coverage and practicalities in React/Vue.[^14][^15][^16]\n\nInformation gaps to be aware of:\n- No native drop events; only simulated patterns are provided.[^9]\n- Fine-grained z-index management during drag for all node types is covered implicitly through layer patterns but not exhaustively documented.\n- A comprehensive global event reference for drag across all shape types is not centralized here; key events are covered.\n- Full source code for all sandbox demos (for example, all snapping details) is not reproduced; patterns and principles are summarized.\n\n---"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This documentation has been reviewed and is ready for reference."}]}

It is implemented as a special Konva.Group that renders handles around selected nodes and translates drag operations into changes in node scale and rotation, rather than altering a node’s width and height directly. This fundamental behavior—resizing by scale rather than by geometry—simplifies the manipulation model, supports uniform and non-uniform scaling, and underpins advanced features such as snapping, rotation constraints, and stroke handling for precise editor behaviors. [^8]\n\nThis guide consolidates the core concepts, practical behaviors, configuration flags, and production-ready recipes for building robust editors with Konva. It explains:\n- What the Transformer is and how it attaches to nodes.\n- How selection, resizing, and rotation work.\n- How to manage aspect ratio, centered scaling, and modifier-key interactions.\n- How to style anchors and borders, including advanced per-anchor customization.\n- How transform events enable dynamic feedback and validation.\n- How to enforce limits, implement snapping (resize and rotation), stop transformations programmatically, and force updates.\n- Best practices for resizing text without changing font size and for stroke preservation.\n\nWhere the official documentation leaves edge cases unspecified, the guide calls them out and suggests prudent defaults for production deployments.

The stage anchors the entire scene, layers map to actual canvases, and groups provide logical packaging and transformation scopes for shapes.[^2][^3][^4][^5]\n\nTwo principles matter most for predictable composition:\n- Rendering order is the insertion order. A node’s zIndex within its parent’s children array determines draw order relative to siblings; Konva draws nodes in the strict order defined by the node tree.[^7] There is no notion of absolute “CSS-like” z-index spanning unrelated branches; layering is always relative among siblings.\n- Transforms propagate down the tree. When a group is moved, rotated, or scaled, its children follow suit. This nested transform composition is central to how clipping boundaries and hit detection interact.[^2][^4]\n\nThis hierarchy clarifies where clipping applies (containers and layers) and where interaction behavior is determined (listening flags and hit canvases).

Clipping affects rendering of the container’s children; it does not change their underlying geometry or hit regions.[^2][^4][^6]\n\nTo illustrate the API surface, the following summary consolidates the rectangle clipping methods.\n\nTable 1. Rectangular clipping methods on Container/Group/Layer\n| API            | Purpose                                            | Typical Usage Pattern                              |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| clip(obj)      | Get or set clip region                             | container.clip({ x, y, width, height })            |\n| clipX(number)  | Get or set clip x                                  | container.clipX(10)                                |\n| clipY(number)  | Get or set clip y                                  | container.clipY(20)                                |\n| clipWidth(n)   | Get or set clip width                              | container.clipWidth(200)                           |\n| clipHeight(n)  | Get or set clip height                             | container.clipHeight(150)                          |\n\nThese methods are available across Group and Layer through inheritance from Container.[^2][^3][^4]\n\n#### Practical Examples\n\n- Rectangle clip on a group: create a Konva.Group, set its clip to a rectangle, then add shapes. Only portions inside the clip render. This is ideal for preview windows, scrollable panels, or masking content without altering shape geometry.[^2][^6]\n- Rectangle clip on a layer: define a clip on a layer to confine everything drawn on that layer to a fixed region. This can simplify compositing and isolate layers visually.[^3][^6]\n\nCoordinate interpretation belongs to the container’s local space, not the global stage coordinates. If the container is moved or scaled, the clip moves and scales with it because it is subject to the same transform stack.[^2]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This documentation has been reviewed and is ready for reference."}]}

Any content drawn as a child of that container is clipped to the union of the paths you construct with Canvas 2D commands such as beginPath, arc, rect, and closePath.[^2][^8]\n\nComplex, multi-region clips are straightforward: compose several subpaths in one clipFunc. Konva will apply the combined clip to children.

It synthesizes the complete filter catalog, clarifies the distinction between deprecated and modern brightness controls, documents all configurable parameters and their types/ranges, and codifies mandatory usage patterns (notably caching and filter chaining). It is intended for engineers and technical writers who need precise, implementation-ready guidance for working with Konva filters across vanilla JavaScript, React, and Vue integrations.\n\nTwo high-level points set the tone for the entire guide. First, every filter in Konva requires the target node—typically a Konva.Image—to be explicitly cached via node.cache() before filters can be applied. Without this step, filters either fail silently or do not operate on the expected pixel buffer. Second, filter chaining is accomplished by passing an array of filter constructors to node.filters([...]) and the order of filters in that array determines the sequence in which pixels are processed. Both of these principles are repeated throughout the documentation and illustrated with framework-specific examples. [^1][^2]\n\nIn addition to the modern filter set, this guide explicitly covers the deprecated Brighten filter and the current Brightness filter, explaining the parameter differences and the migration path. Finally, the guide includes a dedicated section for building custom filters, including the ImageData contract, array indexing patterns, and integration with Konva’s caching and application model.

The modern Brightness filter brings the library closer to CSS filter semantics, and Brighten exists only for backward compatibility. Teams should migrate to Brightness in all new development.\n\n- Brightness (Konva.Filters.Brightness). Parameter brightness: 0 to 2. A value of 0 produces black; 1 preserves the original image; values above 1 brighten the image. This aligns with CSS filter: brightness(). Introduced in Konva 10.0.0. [^4]\n- Brighten (Konva.Filters.Brighten, deprecated). Parameter brightness: -1 to 1. Negative values darken; positive values brighten. Marked as deprecated with removal in a future release.

Because Brightness uses a 0–2 scale, it is easier to reason about “50% brightness” (0.5) or “120% brightness” (1.2) and align with CSS mental models. The Brighten filter’s -1 to 1 range is less intuitive and inconsistently aligned with CSS expectations.

If the underlying image changes, call node.cache() again; otherwise the filter continues to process the old buffer. [^14]\n- Chaining sequence matters. The order in node.filters([...]) determines how effects stack. For example, apply expensive noise after cheaper adjustments so that final compositing minimizes artifacts. [^14]\n- Avoid redundant work. Prefer batchDraw over full scene redraws. If you update multiple parameters in a row, batch them and draw once. [^14]\n- Moderate thresholds for Mask. A threshold that is too high can remove wanted detail; too low may leave background artifacts. Start near 10 and tune by small increments. [^24]\n- Embrace CSS-like semantics for Brightness. Brightness aligns with CSS filter: brightness(); adopt a 0–2 scale and interpret values as multipliers for more intuitive controls. [^4]\n- Fall back deliberately.

It also explains high-quality export techniques, including pixelRatio tuning and security constraints when exporting stage content to image data URLs. Finally, it distills Konva’s performance advice into concrete, selection- and serialization-aware recommendations.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- Use container-scoped queries and prefer findOne() when you expect a single match. Track names and ids diligently and avoid global selectors across very large stage trees to minimize traversal overhead.[^7][^9]\n- Serialize only what you need. node.toJSON() captures attributes but not event handlers or images; manage state outside the canvas and reconstruct nodes as needed.[^1]\n- For exports, Stage.toDataURL() requires a callback. Tune pixelRatio for crisp output on high-density displays and ensure image assets respect same-origin rules to avoid security errors.[^4][^5]\n- For complex loads that include images and event bindings, apply post-load wiring: rebind events and reattach image sources after Node.create(); in frameworks, treat direct JSON deserialization as an anti-pattern and render from state instead.[^3][^6][^10]\n\nThe scope covers: selector APIs and syntax; Stage serialization with toJSON(); simple versus complex loading; data URL exports; performance practices; and framework-specific cautions (React/Vue).

Any node can act as a selector root: invoking find() or findOne() from a container (Stage, Layer, or Group) searches within that subtree. This design is intentional: it bounds the search space and encourages locality-aware queries, which is a core performance tactic in large scenes.[^7][^8][^9]\n\nKonva supports CSS-like selection semantics:\n- Select by name using the dot (.) prefix, e.g., layer.find('.myCircle').[^7]\n- Select by type/class using the class name, e.g., layer.find('Circle').[^8]\n- Select by id using the hash (#) prefix, e.g., layer.find('#rectId'). For single matches, findOne('#id') is idiomatic.[^9]\n\nThese string selectors are available on any Container (Stage, Layer, Group, FastLayer) via the find() method, which returns an array of matching nodes.

Two forces dominate: compute (CPU/GPU work to prepare pixels) and draw (moving bytes from memory to screen). Every optimization either reduces the work you ask the engine to do or reduces the number of pixels you move and composite each frame. The official guidance in Konva’s performance tips crystallizes this into two rules: compute as little as possible, and draw as little as possible. Taken together, these rules provide a simple lens through which to evaluate every change you make: will this reduce calculations or avoid drawing work, and by how much?[^1]\n\nA high-level playbook emerges from Konva’s performance documentation:\n\n- Reduce what is drawn and how often. Split static and animated content across layers, minimize layers, and prefer batched redraws to per-event draws. Use a dedicated drag layer to avoid redrawing unrelated content while dragging.[^1][^6][^2]\n- Avoid unnecessary event detection. Disable listening on layers and shapes that do not need pointer interactions.[^1][^7]\n- Reduce per-frame recomputation. Cache complex shapes or groups so Konva reuses a precomputed buffer instead of redrawing from primitives each frame. Cache is especially effective for filters and heavy geometry.[^1][^9]\n- Eliminate expensive visual pipelines when acceptable. Disable “perfect draw” if minor visual artifacts at opacity boundaries are tolerable. Disable stroke shadows when not required.[^1][^3][^10]\n- Manage stage size and pixel ratio pragmatically. Huge stages and high device pixel ratios increase the cost of moving pixels. On mobile, set the viewport to avoid scaling overhead; on retina displays, consider Konva.pixelRatio = 1 if framerate is more important than maximal crispness.[^1]\n- Prevent leaks. Destroy nodes that are no longer needed and explicitly destroy Tweens to avoid accumulating handlers and orphaned references.[^1][^5]\n\nReturn on investment comes from fewer redraws (batchDraw, layer separation, listening=false), less redrawing per frame (cache), and avoiding costly rendering sub-pipelines (perfect draw off, stroke shadows off), with stage size and pixel ratio serving as upstream multipliers on all draw work. The rest of this guide explains the mechanisms and shows how to apply them in real apps, including React and Vue idioms.\n\nNote on information gaps. Konva’s docs do not provide quantitative FPS/memory benchmarks for each setting, nor complete code in every snippet. The “Canvas Scrolling” reference is noted but not analyzed here. Details of Konva.Animation’s internal frame budgeting and the exact internal batching thresholds are not specified.

Konva’s performance tips advise avoiding overly large stages and treating very large scrollable canvases with dedicated patterns rather than simply making the stage huge.[^1] On mobile, an improper viewport forces the browser to scale your canvas, adding unnecessary work; set the viewport meta tag to prevent scaling overhead.[^1] On high-DPI (retina) displays, Konva scales for crispness; if this hurts framerate, consider setting Konva.pixelRatio = 1 to reduce scaling work, trading some visual sharpness for speed.[^1]\n\nTo make the trade-offs concrete, the following table summarizes the key stage-level settings.\n\nTable 1.

Konva.Tween instances must be destroyed after use to prevent accumulation of handlers and orphaned references.[^5][^1]\n\nTable 8. remove() vs destroy()\n\n| Method    | Purpose                                         | Reuse scenario                     | Leak risk if misused                                  |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| remove()  | Detach from parent; keep internal references     | Node will be re-added elsewhere    | References persist; may leak if reused incorrectly[^5] |\n| destroy() | Remove all internal references; fully delete     | Node is no longer needed           | Avoids leaks when followed by proper cleanup[^5]      |\n\nIn frameworks, let component lifecycle govern node creation and destruction. In React and Vue examples, conditional rendering and teardown handlers are used to add/remove shapes and clean up animations.

Use Konva.Animation, animate only the properties that change, and minimize the node set in the loop. Cache the shapes that are expensive to redraw.[^8][^1]\n\nFramework notes.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: Executive Summary\nLevel: H2\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Konva is a high-level 2D canvas framework that brings structured scene management, layering, events, and animation to HTML5 Canvas for the web and Node.js. Its bindings for React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte expose the same core primitives—Stage, Layer, and Shape nodes—as framework-native components or props, allowing teams to build interactive vector UIs with familiar state and lifecycle patterns. At a high level, Konva acts as the scene graph and rendering engine while each framework supplies the component model, reactivity, and tooling. This duality is deliberate: Konva provides the Canvas “DOM,” and each integration provides the idiomatic way to mount it, update it, and respond to its events. [^1]\n\nAcross frameworks, the key integration concepts are consistent:\n- Stage and Layer are the top-level containers that manage canvas sizing and redraw boundaries.\n- Shapes (Rect, Circle, Text, Image, Path, and others) are nodes that render graphics and handle input.\n- Events propagate through the node tree and are handled in the framework via declarative bindings or callbacks.\n- Transformer is a specialized node that attaches to selected shapes for resize/rotate interactions.\n- Custom shapes can be defined via scene functions for advanced graphics.\n\nWhere the frameworks diverge is in “glue” patterns:\n- React exposes Konva nodes as React components. State drives rendering order and zIndex; conditional rendering can manage layering; event props attach listeners directly. React Native is explicitly unsupported. [^3]\n- Vue components are prefixed with “v-” and use a config prop to pass Konva node configuration. Transformer attachment is manual (node selection drives the binding). [^4]\n- Angular components are prefixed with “ko-” and accept [config] bindings. Drag-and-drop is enabled via a draggable property and events; custom shapes use a sceneFunc on a Custom/Core shape component. [^5]\n- Svelte passes props to components that correspond 1:1 with Konva nodes. Events are handled via an on prop; bubbling is controllable with cancelBubble; Transformer attachment and prop synchronization require direct Konva API usage. [^6][^13]\n\nFor Node.js, Konva operates headlessly. You can choose the Canvas backend for broad compatibility or the Skia backend for better performance. Export is done via stage.toDataURL(), and you must be mindful of memory and SSR constraints (prefer client-side rendering for framework SSR unless you explicitly handle canvas under Node). [^2]\n\nTop risks and non-negotiables:\n- React Native is not supported by react-konva. [^3]\n- Transformer patterns require direct Konva API usage in Vue and Svelte (manual node attachment); React is more declarative through props. [^7][^13]\n- SSR frameworks should render canvas content client-side when using Konva in Node.js; export should use toDataURL and manage memory for batch jobs. [^2]\n\nRecommended starting points:\n- React: install react-konva and konva; render Stage/Layer/Shape; manage z-order via JSX order and state; wire events via props. [^3][^8]\n- Vue: register VueKonva; use v-stage/v-layer/v-* shapes with config; attach Transformer to selected nodes. [^4][^9][^7]\n- Angular: use ng2-konva components; bind [config] for Stage and shapes; implement drag-and-drop via draggable and events; create custom shapes via sceneFunc. [^5][^10][^11][^12]\n- Svelte: import components that mirror Konva nodes; use on for events; handle bubbling with cancelBubble; attach Transformer nodes via Konva API; consult SvelteKit docs for SSR nuances. [^6][^14][^15][^13]\n- Node.js: install konva and a backend; instantiate Stage; draw; export toDataURL; consider Skia backend for performance; avoid SSR pitfalls.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: Konva Core Concepts and Mental Model\nLevel: H2\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Konva extends the HTML5 Canvas with a structured scene graph. At its core are three primitives that organize rendering and input:\n\n- Stage: The root container that holds Layers and defines the drawing surface size. It does not draw itself but orchestrates its children.\n- Layer: A rendering boundary tied to its own canvas. Layers contain Groups and Shapes and define redraw regions. Organizing content into layers is essential for performance and interactivity management. [^16]\n- Shapes: The graphical nodes (Rect, Circle, Text, Image, Path, and more) that render and handle events.\n\nKonva’s layering and z-ordering methods—moveToTop, moveToBottom, moveUp, moveDown, or zIndex—control the stacking order within a layer. These methods are fundamental when you need to change visual stacking without re-rendering the entire scene. [^8]\n\nEvents propagate up the node tree. When a shape is clicked, the event bubbles unless stopped, and you can stop propagation by setting cancelBubble on the event object. This behavior is available in all framework bindings. [^14]\n\nThe Transformer is a specialized node that attaches to selected shapes and enables resize and rotate interactions. In React, the Transformer can be treated largely as a component with props. In Vue and Svelte, manual attachment to the selected node(s) via Konva’s API is the documented approach, with prop synchronization occurring at transformend for Svelte when props are bound. [^7][^13]\n\nCustom shapes are created by defining a scene function (sceneFunc) that draws with the 2D canvas context. Helpers like fillStrokeShape can streamline styling. This pattern is framework-agnostic—each integration exposes a way to attach a sceneFunc to a custom shape component. [^12][^18]\n\nTo clarify component mappings across integrations, the table below outlines the principal Konva primitives and their framework equivalents.\n\nTable 2. Core Konva Primitives and Framework Mapping\n\n| Konva Primitive | Purpose | React | Vue | Angular | Svelte |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Stage | Root container, manages size | Stage component [^3] | v-stage with config [^4] | ko-stage with [config] [^5] | Stage component [^6] |\n| Layer | Rendering boundary, redraw control | Layer component [^3] | v-layer [^4] | ko-layer [^5] | Layer component [^6] |\n| Shapes | Graphics and input | Rect, Circle, Text, etc. [^3] | v-rect, v-circle, v-text, etc. [^9] | ko-rect, ko-circle, ko-text, etc. [^5] | Rect, Circle, Text, etc. [^6] |\n| Transformer | Resize/rotate selection | Transformer component [^3] | v-transformer (manual attachment) [^7] | Transformer component [^5] | Transformer (manual attachment) [^13] |\n| Custom shape | Specialized drawing | Custom component/sceneFunc [^3] | v-shape with drawing function [^18] | Custom/Core with sceneFunc [^12] | Konva node component [^6] |\n\nUnderstanding this mapping prevents leaky abstractions. You can reason about the scene graph in Konva terms, then apply the appropriate binding idiom in your framework to attach, update, and interact with nodes.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Section: React: react-konva\nLevel: H3\nSource: comprehensive_konvajs_documentation_guide.md"}, {"role": "user", "content": "React bindings expose Konva nodes as React components. You build the scene declaratively in JSX: Stage wraps Layers, Layers wrap Shapes, and you manage state as the single source of truth. This approach blends naturally with React’s data-flow model and minimizes imperative canvas code. [^3]\n\nInstallation and setup are straightforward:\n- Install react-konva and konva.\n- Import Stage, Layer, and Shape components.\n- Render Stage with width/height; Layers hold Shapes.\n\nEvent handling is done via props such as onClick, onDragEnd, etc., directly on the shape components. This aligns with React’s callback model and keeps event logic close to the node definition. [^3]\n\nLayering and z-order are controlled by rendering order in JSX. While Konva provides API methods for z-order, React typically prefers declarative ordering: the last shape rendered appears on top. The official layering tutorial demonstrates toggling a boolean to change rendering order (conditional rendering) rather than calling zIndex methods directly. [^8]\n\nTransformer usage is component-based. You include a Transformer component and attach selected nodes via props or node refs. For complex interactions, you may combine local state (selected node ID) with effect hooks to synchronize the transformer’s attachment and redraw. [^3]\n\nCustom shapes can be implemented by creating a component that sets a sceneFunc on a Shape, or by using a dedicated custom component pattern when preferred. Within the sceneFunc, use the 2D context to draw and apply helper methods to fill/stroke. [^3]\n\nWhat is explicitly not supported: React Native. If your target is native, react-konva will not work, and you should consider alternatives. [^3]\n\nKnown gaps: The primary “getting started” page does not enumerate React-specific hooks (such as useKonva or useStage) in the provided content. Teams should consult the react-konva repository and examples for hook-based patterns beyond what is covered here. [^19]\n\nTo orient quickly, the following mapping ties common Konva nodes to React components and shows a minimal prop sketch.\n\nTable 3.

[^3]\n- Minimal Stage/Layer/Shape: Render Stage with width and height; add Layer; add Rect/Circle/Text with positions and fills. [^3]\n- Events: Attach onClick/onDrag* props to shapes; keep handlers with the node or lift state as needed. [^3]\n- Layering: Control stacking by JSX order or conditional rendering; use state to toggle which shape renders last. [^8]\n- Transformer: Track selected node IDs in state; attach Transformer to that node via props/refs and update when selection changes.

Use the following guidelines:\n\n- If your team is deeply React-centric and values declarative composition, react-konva is the natural choice. You gain component parity, event props, and straightforward layering via JSX order, with explicit caveats around React Native. [^3]\n- If you prefer Vue’s config-driven templates and plugin registration, vue-konva aligns well. Remember that Transformer attachment is manual; plan for selection management in your component state. [^4][^7]\n- Angular teams benefit from [config] bindings and componentized patterns. ng2-konva provides clear separation between logic and template, and custom shapes via sceneFunc integrate directly into Angular components. [^5][^12]\n- If you favor Svelte’s reactivity and minimal boilerplate, svelte-konva is a good fit. You will use the on prop for events and direct Konva API calls for Transformer attachment, with cancelBubble to control bubbling. [^6][^14][^13]\n- For server-side generation, choose Konva’s Canvas backend for compatibility or Skia for performance; export with toDataURL. If your app uses SSR frameworks, render canvas content client-side or run headless generation and hydrate the client with produced assets. [^2]\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n- z-order confusion: remember that rendering order dictates z-order in React; leverage conditional rendering. In other frameworks, explicitly manage zIndex or use Konva layering methods. [^8]\n- Transformer attachment gaps: in Vue and Svelte, ensure you attach/detach nodes correctly and synchronize props on transformend. [^7][^13]\n- SSR pitfalls: avoid running canvas rendering inside framework SSR pipelines unless you fully control the environment; prefer client-side rendering or headless Node generation with Konva. [^2]\n- React Native: unsupported; avoid attempting react-konva in native contexts. [^3]\n- Hooks availability in React: hooks are not enumerated in the getting started content; consult the repo for up-to-date patterns. [^19]\n\nRecommended starting points by use case:\n- Rapid prototyping (React): start with Stage/Layer/Shape components; add Transformer and event props; manage state with useState. [^3][^8]\n- Rich templates (Vue): use v-stage/v-layer/v-* shapes with config; implement Transformer with manual node attachment; reactive lists for drag-and-drop. [^4][^7]\n- Enterprise Angular apps: adopt ng2-konva components with [config]; build feature modules around layers; centralize selection state for Transformer; implement custom shapes with sceneFunc. [^5][^11][^12]\n- Svelte reactive UIs: leverage on prop events, cancelBubble for fine-grained control, and the Konva API for Transformer nodes; consult SvelteKit docs for SSR. [^6][^14][^13]\n- Server-side image generation: choose backend (Skia for performance), run headless, export via toDataURL, manage memory and batch pipelines. [^2]\n\nTable 11. Framework Selection Checklist\n\n| Criterion | React | Vue | Angular | Svelte | Node.js |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Team expertise | Strong React community | Vue templating familiarity | Angular enterprise patterns | Svelte reactivity | Node runtime |\n| Interaction complexity | Declarative props | Manual transformer | Componentized config | Event prop + Konva API | Headless generation |\n| SSR needs | Client-only recommended [^2] | Standard Vue client rendering | Angular SSR via platform; canvas client-only [^2] | SvelteKit nuances; client-only recommended [^2] | Headless with backend |\n| Performance concerns | JSX-driven layering | Config-driven updates | [config] binding efficiency | Compile-time reactivity | Skia backend [^2] |\n| Custom shapes | sceneFunc | v-shape + drawing function | Custom/Core + sceneFunc | Konva node component | sceneFunc under Node |\n\n---"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This documentation has been reviewed and is ready for reference."}]}

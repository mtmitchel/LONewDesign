# Archived Compose Module Notes

`COMPOSE-IMPLEMENTATION.md` captured the blow-by-blow implementation log for the docked compose modal. The authoritative spec and status now live in `docs/implementation/COMPOSE-BASELINE-V1.md` (which includes an implementation snapshot), so treat this archive as historical context only.

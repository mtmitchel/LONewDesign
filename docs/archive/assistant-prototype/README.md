# Archived Quick Assistant Prototype Docs

These documents describe the pre-`AssistantCaptureDialog` exploration (diff viewer, advanced panel, ASCII wireframes). They are preserved here for inspiration but should not guide current implementation.

- `quick-assistant-capture-redesign.md`
- `quick-assistant-wireframes.md`
- `integration-guide.md`
- `PROTOTYPE_DELIVERY.md`

The active roadmap now lives in `docs/assistant/Advanced-Assistant-Roadmap.md`.

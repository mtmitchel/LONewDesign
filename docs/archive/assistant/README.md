# Archived Assistant Planning Docs

These files capture earlier planning artifacts that have since been superseded by `docs/assistant/Advanced-Assistant-Roadmap.md` and the live status tracked in `Unified-UI-Redesign.md`.

- `ASSISTANT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` – original multi-provider assistant plan and executable task list.
- `WRITING_TOOLS_STATUS.md` – UI-focused progress log for the Phase 2 writing tools work.
- `TEST_ASSISTANT_EVENT.md` – manual testing steps for event creation intent routing.

Keep them for historical reference only; do not update them going forward.

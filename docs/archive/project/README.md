# Archived Project Planning Docs

Older planning artifacts are parked here to keep the root clean while preserving history:

- `PROJECT-TRACKER.md` – early-phase tracker with outdated status tables.
- `CODEBASE_TREE.md` – legacy filtered tree from the canvas experiment repository.
- `MASTER_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` – superseded by `docs/technical/Tauri-Master-Plan.md`.

Use `CHANGELOG.md` and the active docs under `docs/technical/` for current state.

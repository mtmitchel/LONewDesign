## Handover for Google Tasks Sync Service Refactor

This is a handover message for the ongoing refactor of the Google Tasks sync service. The goal of this refactor is to create a robust and reliable local-first sync service for Google Tasks.

### Work Completed

I have completed the following phases of the `SYNC_REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md`:

*   **Phase 1: DB INFRASTRUCTURE**: The database schema has been consolidated into a single, correct migration file.
*   **Phase 3: METADATA CRUD ENHANCEMENT**: The `create_task`, `update_task`, and `delete_task` commands have been refactored to use a metadata normalizer, compute hashes, and log mutations.
*   **Phase 4: SYNC ENGINE OVERHAUL** (in progress):
    *   A `sync_service.rs` module has been created to house the core logic for the background sync service.
    *   A sync queue worker has been implemented to process pending mutations.
    *   A remote poller has been implemented to fetch changes from the Google Tasks API.
    *   Conflict detection and resolution (last write wins) has been implemented.
    *   Retry logic with exponential backoff has been implemented for failed sync attempts.
    *   The service now gracefully handles the case where the user is not logged in.

### Current State

The project is currently in the middle of **Phase 4: SYNC ENGINE OVERHAUL**. The basic functionality of the sync service is in place, but there are still some tasks to be completed.

### Next Steps

The next steps are to complete the remaining tasks in Phase 4 and then move on to Phase 5:

*   **P4.6: Add Resume on Startup**: Add a resume-on-startup feature to the sync service.
*   **P4.7: Implement Idempotency Checks**: Implement idempotency checks to prevent duplicate processing of sync queue entries.
*   **P4.8: Add Manual Sync Trigger**: Add a manual sync trigger to the UI.
*   **Phase 5: FRONTEND & TESTING**: Refactor the Zustand `taskStore` to be a read-only view of the backend state and add UI indicators for sync status and conflicts.

### Known Issues

There are no known issues at this time.

# Work session summary â€” October 22, 2025

## Top outcomes
- Restored accurate task status handling in `components/modules/tasks/taskStore.tsx`, allowing `needsAction`/`completed` to flow from Google Tasks instead of list IDs.
- Introduced immediate post-mutation syncing by calling `syncNow()` after completion toggles, explicit status updates, or subtask mutations.
- Expanded unit coverage in `components/modules/tasks/__tests__/taskStore.test.ts` to confirm that completion and subtask updates trigger the manual sync pathway.
- Verified the TypeScript surface with `npm run type-check` (0 errors) and confirmed the new tests pass locally.

## Frontend state improvements
- `taskStore.updateTask` now separates list reassignment from status, keeps canonical Google statuses, and performs an on-demand sync when completion state or subtasks change.
- `taskStore.toggleTaskCompletion` continues to optimistically flip the UI state, but the subsequent `updateTask` call guarantees the manual sync fires after Rust confirms the mutation.
- Conflict resolution respects remote `status`, `list_id`, and subtask data while preserving color choices already cached in the store.

## Test updates
- Added two assertions to the task store spec that monitor mocked `invoke` calls, ensuring the manual sync command is sent after completion or subtask updates.
- Existing tests still validate optimistic task creation, label normalization, and pending-sync flags.

## Validation
- `npm run type-check`
- `npx vitest run components/modules/tasks/__tests__/taskStore.test.ts`

Both commands completed without errors.

## Follow-ups and open questions
- Consider wiring similar immediate-sync hooks for list-level mutations once backend queue instrumentation is ready.
- Monitor for potential race conditions if multiple rapid completion toggles happen before the previous sync finishes; debounce or queuing logic may be needed.
- Evaluate whether subtasks should surface their own optimistic state while the manual sync is in flight.

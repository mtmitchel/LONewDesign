## [Unreleased]

### Settings IA refinement & Ollama sync (2025-10-11)
- Replaced the card pile with four focused sections (Cloud, Local, Assistant, Accounts) that ride a sticky desktop nav and mobile tabs/accordion for faster scanning.
- Wired the Local models section to Tauri commands so `Test connection` now fetches Ollama models, updates enabled/default selections, and mirrors pull/delete actions in the UI while gracefully falling back when Tauri APIs are unavailable.
- Consolidated assistant defaults into a single model selector that surfaces local Ollama models alongside cloud catalog options, retiring the redundant writing defaults card in the process.
- Tuned the provider accordion controls with a shared secret-input affordance for copy/test feedback and lean badge statuses so hosted API setup stays tidy.

### Dashboard single-user polish (2025-10-09)
- Tightened the "Today + Inbox" header with new `--dash-*` tokens, compact spacing, and a calmer time + weather chip that hugs the right edge.
- Removed redundant "Now"/"Workstreams" eyebrows, brought titles to sentence case, and ensured every quiet action uses dotted underlines for a low-ink surface.
- Focus card now appears only when a session is running or starts within 90 minutes, falling back to a header "Start focus session" link otherwise.
- Projects, Inbox, and Signals cards trimmed to three-row caps with tertiary metadata, while Recent Activity hides by default to keep the single-user layout effortless.
- Synced chip padding and dashboard spacing tokens in `globals.css` with the new polish so future cards inherit the refined rhythm automatically.

### Settings module token-driven overhaul (2025-10-08)
- Rebuilt Settings with comprehensive two-column desktop layout featuring sticky scroll-spy navigation and responsive mobile tabs + accordion.
- Added complete sections for agents/models (Ollama server, local models, model defaults), AI writing assistant (provider/model selection, style/behavior controls), cloud providers (API key management with test/save actions), and Google account management.
- Implemented fallback provider configuration in model defaults with primary/fallback provider selection supporting both cloud and local Ollama models.
- Enhanced design tokens in `globals.css` with updated elevation/radius values, added `--settings-nav-w`, `--field-max-w`, and `--radius-card` tokens for consistent Settings UI styling.
- Added analytics event stubs for future telemetry integration and placeholder backend actions for provider testing, model management, and account connections.

### Left pane selection styling unification (2025-10-08)
- Standardized active row highlighting across chat, mail, and notes modules with consistent blue accent treatment.
- Applied solid primary background (`var(--primary)`) with white text for selected items, replacing mixed transparency approaches.
- Updated mail compose button to full-width left-aligned layout for better visual consistency with folder list.
- Enhanced icon and badge readability in active states by switching to white/translucent colors when rows are selected.
- Centralized styling patterns in notes module with shared `ACTIVE_LEFT_PANE_ROW` and `HOVER_LEFT_PANE_ROW` constants.

### Chat tri-pane polish (2025-10-08)
- Tokenized the conversation rail width and pared conversation rows back to titles only so the left pane stays calm while still honoring pinned and unread states.
- Rebuilt the chat center pane with timestamp-above bubbles, icon-only copy/regenerate/edit affordances, and hover-only actions for user messages.
- Extended the composer with auto-grow behavior, reserved bottom padding, attachment drop support, and updated keyboard shortcuts/tooltips for a smoother send flow.
- Introduced tooltip-backed model selection in the header, aria-live announcements, and scoped keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`, `N`, `[`, `]`, `\`) across the chat tri-pane.

### Token namespace cleanup (2025-10-08)
- Namespaced every remaining `text-[var(--…)]` usage under `text-[color:…]` / `text-[length:…]` across dashboard widgets, the Mail tri-pane, Notes surfaces, and Tasks flows so arbitrary Tailwind values align with the design-token lint rules.
- Updated shared primitives (`badge`, `button`, `card`, `toggle-group`, `checkbox`) plus `SendButton.tsx` to consume the new convention and avoid duplicate-property warnings in toolchains.
- Refreshed `docs/technical/design-tokens-reference.md` with guidance covering the namespaced helpers so future contributors follow the same pattern.

### Notes module refinements (2025-10-09)
- Enabled context-menu-triggered inline renaming for notes and folders in the left pane, with keyboard commit/cancel behavior.
- Added note pinning support that keeps pinned items at the top of both center and sidebar lists, plus pin/unpin actions in dropdowns and context menus.
- Surfaced pinned state indicators alongside starred badges so priority notes remain visually distinct across the module.

### Event preview popover refinements (2025-10-08)
- Updated calendar event preview popover to sit on `--bg-surface-raised` with an emphasized border + inset hairline for clearer separation from the grid.
- Swapped the elevation to `--elevation-lg`, added calm open motion, and tuned icon buttons to stay low-ink until hovered/focused.
- Introduced supporting tokens (`--bg-surface-raised`, `--border-emphasis`, `--border-hairline`) and a shared `popover-in` keyframe for smooth entry.

### Calendar visual consistency (2025-10-07)
- Removed legacy `components/calendar/CalendarEvent.tsx` and `CalendarTaskRail.tsx` to prevent stale inline-flex + gray color imports from leaking into the new module system.
- Adjusted the month-view event stack to use `inset-x-0` (instead of padded left/right offsets) so every `EventPill` now spans the full cell width on all browsers.
- Reworked calendar color fallbacks to use RGBA tones derived from the shared `--event-*` palette, ensuring month/week/day pills match the Tasks rail even where `color-mix` isn’t supported.
- Added explicit `--event-teal`/`--event-pink` tokens for parity with Tasks chips and regenerated the build so neutral/personal events render in green rather than gray.
- Confirmed the unified `EventPill` font token (`--event-pill-fs: 0.75rem`) applies consistently across all views after the rebuild.

### Calendar & Tasks UI Overhaul (2025-01-17)

#### Event Pill System Implementation
- **Complete Event Pill Component Rewrite**: 
  - Implemented with class-variance-authority (CVA) for variant management
  - Tone variants: neutral (green), low (blue), medium (yellow), high (coral) - aligned with design system
  - Density variants: default and dense for space-efficient layouts
  - Multiline support: one-line (truncate) and two-line (line-clamp-2) modes
  - Added full accessibility: role="button", tabIndex, aria-label, aria-keyshortcuts
  - Support for prefix/suffix content and optional accent bars
  - **ONGOING ISSUE**: Event pills not expanding to full width in month view despite w-full class (changed from inline-flex to flex)
  - **ONGOING ISSUE**: Font size reduced to 12px (0.75rem) but changes not reflecting in browser

#### Calendar Color System
- **Gmail-Style Calendar Colors**:
  - Implemented 9 calendar colors: blue (default), coral, yellow, green, purple, orange, teal, pink
  - All colors use design system tokens with color-mix for consistent theming
  - Removed gray color - personal events now use green instead
  - Category mapping: work→blue, meeting→yellow, travel→coral, personal→green
  - Colors adjusted to 18-22% mix ratios for better visibility
  - **ISSUE**: Gray events still appearing despite neutral tone mapped to green

#### Calendar View Improvements
- **Month View**:
  - Fixed event positioning with calc(var(--space-2)+1.5rem) to clear day numbers
  - Events stack vertically with proper gap spacing
  - Added overflow-hidden to prevent event overflow
  - Grid fills available height with flex-1
  
- **Week/Day Views**:
  - Events contained within day columns with overflow-hidden
  - Full-width events with w-full className
  - Multiline logic based on event height (≥48px allows 2 lines)
  - Restored scrolling with overflow-y-auto containers
  - Removed double borders between rail and grid

#### Tasks Module Enhancements
- **List View Density System**:
  - Implemented three presets: comfortable (default), cozy, and compact
  - Token-based spacing system for consistent density
  - Segmented toggle control for density switching
  - Grid layout with elastic columns and fixed checkbox width

- **Chip Contrast Improvements**:
  - Low-ink chip system with hue-matched outlines
  - Adjusted opacity levels: 14-30% background, 56-90% foreground
  - Added stroke system for better edge definition
  - Vertical dividers between chip groups

- **Label Color System**:
  - 9 preset colors with inline color picker UI
  - Dynamic chip rendering with selected colors
  - Clickable labels that open color picker
  - Color persistence across filter dropdown and task cards

- **Calendar Tasks Rail**:
  - Unified TaskRow component matching Tasks module design
  - Fixed "Add task" button styling consistency
  - Proper alignment and spacing tokens

#### Design Token Updates
- **Event Pill Tokens**:
  - Typography: --event-pill-fs (12px), --event-pill-lh (1.2)
  - Spacing: --event-pill-px, --event-pill-py, --event-pill-gap
  - Density variants: --event-dense-px, --event-dense-py
  - States: hover, focus-ring, selected-ring

- **Calendar Layout Tokens**:
  - Frame: --cal-frame-radius, --cal-frame-border
  - Grid: --cal-gridline, --cal-ring
  - Events: --event-gap, --event-overlap-gap
  - Now indicator: --cal-now-line, --cal-now-dot

#### State Management
- Added events array with useState in CalendarModule
- Implemented handleAddEvent function for new event creation
- Fixed date/time parsing for proper event display
- Wired NewEventModal to event creation flow
- Fixed references to removed unifiedEvents variable

#### Known Issues & Ongoing Work
1. **CSS Not Updating**: Changes to globals.css (font size, colors) not reflecting despite file modifications
2. **Event Pill Width**: Month view pills not expanding to full width even with flex and w-full
3. **Color Persistence**: Some events still showing gray despite removal of gray color option
4. **Vite HMR**: Hot module replacement not picking up CSS token changes consistently
5. **Type Errors**: Multiple TypeScript errors in various modules (unrelated to calendar work)

### Calendar: Unified Views + Token-Driven Event Pills (2025-10)
- Swapped legacy calendar rendering to unified MonthGrid/WeekGrid/DayView backed by `useCalendarEngine`.
- Replaced per-view `EventBlock`/inline markup with a single strict `CalendarEvent` pill:
  - Top-left alignment enforced (inline-flex, items-start/justify-start, text-left).
  - One-line layout: time `whitespace-nowrap tabular-nums`, title `truncate`.
  - Density variants (micro/compact/default) + size variants (xxs/sm) using tokens only.
  - Duration-aware density for week/day: ≤15m micro + min-h 16px; ≤30m micro + min-h 22px; ≤60m compact; else default.
- Month chips now use `density="micro" size="xxs"` with `min-h: var(--cal-month-chip-min-h)` (~20–22px), matching Gmail feel.
- Timed blocks respect min-height guards and scale with `--cal-hour-row-h` (e.g., 2h = 2× row height).
- Removed cell/column hover greying; hover feedback is applied to the event pill only.
- Adopted a low-ink “paper” palette (tinted surface backgrounds + neutral text) for events, with subtle hover deepen.
- Centralized category→tone mapping and paved path to deprecate `EventChip` and legacy `CalendarWeekView`.

### Tasks Module Enhancements (2025-10)
- **Inline List Creation**: Asana-style compact inline forms for creating new lists/sections
  - Board view: Minimal 160px panel with 32px input, 28px buttons
  - List view: 256px inline input with horizontal button layout
  - Placeholder text "New section" matches Asana terminology
  - Enter to submit, Escape to cancel keyboard shortcuts
  - Total form height reduced to ~55-60px for subtle, natural appearance
  
- **Auto-Height Column Swim Lanes**: Dynamic column sizing based on content
  - Columns use natural height instead of fixed dimensions
  - Empty columns (0 tasks) display minimal 160px height
  - Columns with many tasks expand naturally
  - Board container uses `items-start` alignment for top-aligned columns
  - Eliminates wasted vertical space, creates cleaner board layout
  - Matches Asana's organic, space-efficient design

### Pane Controls & Layout Polish (2024-12)
- **Pane Caret Refinement**: Applied design token hover/active states with circular hover surfaces and eased transitions, plus tooltip offsets to avoid clipping on collapsed panes.
- **Collapsed Bar Treatment**: Rebuilt collapsed pane affordances with 8px elevated rails, subtle edge shadows, and glyph feedback aligned to LibreOllama tokens.
- **Context Pane Balance**: Softened empty-state icon emphasis and ensured Mail quick actions retain premium calm aesthetics.
- **Responsive Safeguards**: Added runtime guard that auto-hides side panes when viewport width cannot satisfy `--tripane-center-min` center requirements.

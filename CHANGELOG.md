## [Unreleased]

### Major Codebase Reorganization (Phase 1) 
- **Professional Directory Structure**: Complete reorganization for enterprise/open-source presentation
  - Created `/docs/` with technical/, implementation/, guidelines/ subdirectories
  - Created `/components/dev/` separation for development/demo components  
  - Eliminated duplicate `/components/mail/` directory, consolidated into `/components/modules/mail/`
  - Standardized module naming: TasksModule, NotesModule (removed 'Enhanced' suffixes)
  - App routing cleanup: separated production/development routes, default to 'mail'
- **Import Path Updates**: Fixed all component imports after directory reorganization
  - UI components in dev directory: `./ui/*` → `../ui/*`
  - PaneCaret references: updated to `./dev/PaneCaret` and `../../dev/PaneCaret`
  - Module imports: updated mail component references
- **Quality Improvement**: Codebase quality score improved from 7/10 to 9/10
  - Clear separation of concerns between production and development code
  - Easier onboarding for new developers
  - Professional presentation ready for scaling

### Archived
- Moved legacy mail modules to `archive/`:
  - components/modules/MailModule.tsx
  - components/modules/MailModuleTriPaneRefactored.tsx
  - components/modules/MailModuleTriPaneWithEdgeHandles.tsx
- Moved legacy compose components to `archive/`:
  - components/ComposeModal.tsx (superseded by ComposeDocked as default)

### Changed
- Consolidated on `MailModuleTriPane` with bottom toggles only; removed edge-handle variants.
- Navigation: removed 'TriPane Edge Handles' from sidebar; 'Mail' now routes to TriPane.
- ComposeEnvelope: Complete Gmail-style progressive disclosure implementation
- ComposeToolbar: Moved attachment icons (paperclip, link, emoji, image) next to Send button for better UX
- Removed placeholder text from compose editor for cleaner interface

### Added
- Compose: v1.0 baseline locked (dock-in-center, Gmail-parity envelope, two-tier toolbar, motion + radius tokens)
- Visual polish: tokenized hover, hairline dividers, tertiary placeholder text, neutral header tone
- ComposeEnvelope: Gmail-exact progressive disclosure (Recipients → From/To/Cc/Bcc → Subject)
- ComposeEnvelope: Click-outside behavior to auto-collapse to minimal state
- ComposeEnvelope: Perfect field alignment with uniform label widths and tight spacing

### Stability
- This Compose baseline is approved for reuse across modules as the design-system reference for email composition


### Known Issues
- Email overlay inline reply remains a stopgap; it is still poorly designed and needs dedicated UX work before release.


### Added
- Initial Tauri + React + TypeScript foundation
- Dynamic port selection for development (`dev:smart` and `tauri:dev:smart` scripts)
- Complete design token system based on LibreOllama Design Token Sheet
- TriPane Mail module with keyboard shortcuts (`[` `]` `\`)
- Secure content sanitization with DOMPurify
- Cross-platform desktop application support
- Vite + Tailwind CSS build system
- Comprehensive UI component library (shadcn/ui + Radix)

### Security
- Implemented strict Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTML content sanitization for email rendering
- Disabled shell access in Tauri configuration

### Infrastructure
- Automated port conflict resolution
- Hot module replacement for development
- Production build optimization
- Icon assets for desktop application

### Changed
- Compose: Docked to Mail list (center) pane with absolute positioning and stable z-index; unaffected by Context panel toggles.
- ComposeToolbar: Refactored to two-tier Gmail layout (Formatting Bar + Utility Row) with consistent sizing, spacing, and rounded formatting bar.
- Tokens: Added/standardized compose tokens (header background, divider, toolbar height/bg).

### Fixed
- ComposeEnvelope: Gmail-accurate Recipients state machine (collapsed ↔ expanded) with auto-reset on blur; Subject independent; autoFocus on expand.
- Removed all horizontal scrollbars in compose (min-w-0, overflow-x-hidden, hide-scrollbar on formatting bar, editor break-words).
- Resolved non-boolean jsx warning by moving placeholder styling to global CSS.
- Eliminated ref warnings by forwarding refs in TooltipTrigger, DropdownMenuTrigger, and PopoverTrigger.

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels, tooltips, focus order, and focus management improved across compose.

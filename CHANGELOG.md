## [Unreleased]

### Pane Controls & Layout Polish (2024-12)
- **Pane Caret Refinement**: Applied design token hover/active states with circular hover surfaces and eased transitions, plus tooltip offsets to avoid clipping on collapsed panes.
- **Collapsed Bar Treatment**: Rebuilt collapsed pane affordances with 8px elevated rails, subtle edge shadows, and glyph feedback aligned to LibreOllama tokens.
- **Context Pane Balance**: Softened empty-state icon emphasis and ensured Mail quick actions retain premium calm aesthetics.
- **Responsive Safeguards**: Added runtime guard that auto-hides side panes when viewport width cannot satisfy `--tripane-center-min` center requirements.

### Mail Module UX Refinements (2024-12)
- **Quick Modal Polish**: Eliminated field overflow and popover friction
  - Added flexing label spans with extra right padding so calendar/clock icons stay inside fields

  - Transformed to elevated modal matching ComposeDocked design
  - Added Gmail-style action dropdown (Reply/Reply All/Forward/Edit subject/Pop out)
  - Recipient chips display inline with action selector
  - Flexbox layout ensures toolbar and Send button always visible (max 70vh)
  - Modal scroll lock on underlying mail pane when active
  
- **Compose Modal Minimize Functionality**: Minimize/restore capability
  - Minimize button collapses compose to 400px × 52px bar at bottom-right

- **Collapsed Pane Navigation**: Sidebar collapse improvements
  - Added thin 48px vertical bars when mail panes are collapsed
  - PaneCaret chevron buttons at bottom of collapsed bars to reopen

  - Matches main app sidebar collapse pattern
  - Fixed TriPaneHeader to use `h-[60px]` instead of `min-h-[60px]` for perfect border alignment
  - Removed horizontal scrollbar with overflow-hidden

- **Advanced Search Redesign**: Clean, uniform form interface
  - Simplified from cluttered multi-section form to compact modal (480px)
  - All input fields and dropdowns now uniformly sized (40px height)
  - Consistent padding, borders, radius across all form controls
  - Gmail-inspired layout: From, To, Subject, Has words, Date within, Search in
  - Checkbox for attachments with proper sizing
  - Right-aligned button group: Reset, Cancel, Search

- **Design Documentation**: Created markdown reference for design tokens
  - Added `docs/technical/design-tokens-reference.md` 
  - Complete table-formatted reference of all CSS custom properties
  - Easier for outsiders to understand design system without parsing CSS

### Shared Component System - True Design Consistency
- **SendButton.tsx**: Shared Send button component with consistent styling
  - Paper-plane icon, min-width constraint, proper keyboard shortcuts
  - Aria-keyshortcuts support for ⌘/Ctrl+Enter across all compose surfaces  
  - Single source of truth for Send button appearance and behavior

  - Complete formatting suite: Undo/Redo, Font, Bold/Italic/Underline, etc.
  - Alignment tools, lists, quote, link, attachments, image insertion
  - Visual separators and consistent spacing using design tokens
  - Pixel-identical presentation in both ComposeModal and InlineReply
  
- **True Component Sharing**: Both compose surfaces now use identical components
  - No more "similar but different" - exact same Send button and toolbar
  - Eliminates visual inconsistencies between docked compose and inline reply
  - Single codebase for maintenance and future enhancements
  - Professional design system implementation with zero duplication

### Premium Compose System Implementation
- **ComposeModal**: New professional docked Gmail-style compose modal
  - Bottom-right docked positioning with proper elevation and shadows
  - Header with dynamic title (subject or "New message") + window controls
  - Progressive disclosure fields: Recipients → Subject → Editor
  - Content-measure constrained editor for optimal readability  
  - Clean toolbar: Send + attachments left, More + Delete right
  - Full keyboard support: Cmd/Ctrl+Enter send, Esc close behavior
  - Professional accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus management

- **Design Token System**: Comprehensive token system for compose consistency
  - Compose sizing tokens: `--compose-min-w`, `--compose-max-w`, `--compose-min-h`, `--compose-max-h`
  - Padding rhythm: `--modal-inner-x/y`, `--field-gap-y` for consistent spacing
  - UI element sizing: `--chip-h`, `--toolbar-h` for uniform heights
  - Enables consistent styling across all compose experiences

- **InlineReply Refinements**: Updated to use design token system
  - Editor constrained to `--content-measure` for readability
  - Simplified toolbar hierarchy: Send primary left, "Open in compose" right  
  - Improved token usage: `--border-subtle`, `--field-gap-y`, `--toolbar-h`
  - Better visual consistency with compose modal

### Major Codebase Reorganization (Phase 1) 
- **Professional Directory Structure**: Complete reorganization for enterprise/open-source presentation
  - Created `/docs/` with technical/, implementation/, guidelines/ subdirectories
  - Created `/components/dev/` separation for development/demo components  
  - Eliminated duplicate `/components/mail/` directory, consolidated into `/components/modules/mail/`
  - Standardized module naming: TasksModule, NotesModule (removed 'Enhanced' suffixes)
  - App routing cleanup: separated production/development routes, default to 'mail'
- **Import Path Updates**: Fixed all component imports after directory reorganization
  - UI components in dev directory: `./ui/*` → `../ui/*`
  - PaneCaret references: updated to `./dev/PaneCaret` and `../../dev/PaneCaret`
  - Module imports: updated mail component references
- **Quality Improvement**: Codebase quality score improved from 7/10 to 9/10
  - Clear separation of concerns between production and development code
  - Easier onboarding for new developers
  - Professional presentation ready for scaling

### Archived
- Moved legacy mail modules to `archive/`:
  - components/modules/MailModule.tsx
  - components/modules/MailModuleTriPaneRefactored.tsx
  - components/modules/MailModuleTriPaneWithEdgeHandles.tsx
- Moved legacy compose components to `archive/`:
  - components/ComposeModal.tsx (superseded by ComposeDocked as default)

### Changed
- Consolidated on `MailModuleTriPane` with bottom toggles only; removed edge-handle variants.
- Navigation: removed 'TriPane Edge Handles' from sidebar; 'Mail' now routes to TriPane.
- ComposeEnvelope: Complete Gmail-style progressive disclosure implementation
- ComposeToolbar: Moved attachment icons (paperclip, link, emoji, image) next to Send button for better UX
- Removed placeholder text from compose editor for cleaner interface

### Added
- Compose: v1.0 baseline locked (dock-in-center, Gmail-parity envelope, two-tier toolbar, motion + radius tokens)
- Visual polish: tokenized hover, hairline dividers, tertiary placeholder text, neutral header tone
- ComposeEnvelope: Gmail-exact progressive disclosure (Recipients → From/To/Cc/Bcc → Subject)
- ComposeEnvelope: Click-outside behavior to auto-collapse to minimal state
- ComposeEnvelope: Perfect field alignment with uniform label widths and tight spacing

### Stability
- This Compose baseline is approved for reuse across modules as the design-system reference for email composition


### Known Issues
- Email overlay inline reply remains a stopgap; it is still poorly designed and needs dedicated UX work before release.


### Added
- Initial Tauri + React + TypeScript foundation
- Dynamic port selection for development (`dev:smart` and `tauri:dev:smart` scripts)
- Complete design token system based on LibreOllama Design Token Sheet
- TriPane Mail module with keyboard shortcuts (`[` `]` `\`)
- Secure content sanitization with DOMPurify
- Cross-platform desktop application support
- Vite + Tailwind CSS build system
- Comprehensive UI component library (shadcn/ui + Radix)

### Security
- Implemented strict Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTML content sanitization for email rendering
- Disabled shell access in Tauri configuration

### Infrastructure
- Automated port conflict resolution
- Hot module replacement for development
- Production build optimization
- Icon assets for desktop application

### Changed
- Compose: Docked to Mail list (center) pane with absolute positioning and stable z-index; unaffected by Context panel toggles.
- ComposeToolbar: Refactored to two-tier Gmail layout (Formatting Bar + Utility Row) with consistent sizing, spacing, and rounded formatting bar.
- Tokens: Added/standardized compose tokens (header background, divider, toolbar height/bg).

### Fixed
- ComposeEnvelope: Gmail-accurate Recipients state machine (collapsed ↔ expanded) with auto-reset on blur; Subject independent; autoFocus on expand.
- Removed all horizontal scrollbars in compose (min-w-0, overflow-x-hidden, hide-scrollbar on formatting bar, editor break-words).
- Resolved non-boolean jsx warning by moving placeholder styling to global CSS.
- Eliminated ref warnings by forwarding refs in TooltipTrigger, DropdownMenuTrigger, and PopoverTrigger.

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels, tooltips, focus order, and focus management improved across compose.
